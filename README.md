# ShAI-Assignment
This repo is made for the required ShAI task in order to get into the bootcamp in which I completed all 7 required tasks on the dataset.<br><br>
All code and explanation is written within the Jupyter Notebook file ___(ShAI_BootCamp_Assignment.ipynb)___ alnog with all the required visualization which I have conducted using Plotly. <br><br>
The original dataset **(Salaries.csv)** is also present. <br><br>
A modified version of the dataset **(Salaries_no_null_values.xlsx)** which contains no missing values is present as well. <br><br>

NOTES: 
- The 7 required tasks can be seen at the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook file.
- The Jupyter Notebook file is big and might not be able to be rendered on github, please download it and view it locally if that is the case.
- All visualization was done using Plotly library.
